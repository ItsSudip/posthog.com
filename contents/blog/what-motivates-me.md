We got pretty far (16k customers, did YC, seed, series A and B raised, $MM revenue) before I really figured out what motivates me.

## Building the _exact_ place I'd want to work

I've worked at a bunch of startups before. They all had _many_ flaws. Neither Tim nor I can imagine working anywhere else, ever.

## Was it just being a rocket ship?

We've been much more focused on staying lean as we grow for the last year, despite all of our fastest growth coming in this time, including revenue.

My motivation has gone _up_ as we've been more lean. I'm getting more and more proud of what we're working on. Being lean forces us to prioritize. We no longer half ass lots of things, we nail a smaller number of them.

Prioritization doesn't just mean picking the right task to work on, it also means picking the right people to work with. We're getting stronger over time rather than lowering our bar on hiring.

## But I really want to beat other companies

When I used to race bikes, I did a lot of time trialling. Someone sets off every minute to race around the course as fast as possible.

The moment you see another rider ahead of you, you magically roar past them - every time.

In the long run, there are some huge companies I want to beat.

## This feels like a long list

But everything on it is under the same umbrella.

Those huge companies:

* are closed source
* are sales led
* provide products that aren't extensible
* have terrible documentation
* are messy internally
* have a bland corporate vibe

I want to show to the world that you can beat the biggest companies, specifically _by_ doing everything the right way. We've built a real brand by getting the above right so far. It has often meant short term pain for long term gain. And we're going to keep it that way.
